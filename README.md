# LINK
 Language Integration Network Kit


CONTAGIO and ISARIC present LINK, the Language Integration Network Kit. It is a platform and tool to verify automatic machine translations of the ARC database. 

With the help of users from around the world, we hope to make the BRIDGE application as accessible and helpful to clinicians and researchers everywhere.

LINK uses Svelte, Typescript, TailwindCSS, Supabase, and GitHub GraphQL.
